#  Reasons to Install APIC-EM at Home
Really, you can learn a lot with APIC-EM in DevNet without installing it at home. When you are thinking about whether it is time for you to add APIC-EM to your lab, think about these good reasons to install it at home:

## Topology and Configuration Advantages
With your own home lab, you get complete control of what network devices to use, the topology to use, and the configurations. In Learning Labs, the network device configuration and topology are set. In the Sandboxes that use real/virtual network device instances, you can change the device configurations, but the topology remains the same. In short, you probably have more flexibility with the network topology and configuration in your home lab.

## Availability Advantages
In your own lab, your own APIC-EM instance and your own network devices should be available any time you want to use them. DevNet Sandboxes do not always meet that standard. Always-on Sandboxes are of course meant to be available, but those backed by real/virtual network devices require a reservation with setup time. That may mean the lab isn’t available when you want to use it. Also, there is usually some time (estimated 30 minutes) of time for the lab automation to bring up and configure the real and virtual devices in a Sandbox, so there is some time lag there as well.

With you own home lab, you should be able to boot your APIC-EM instance with your own lab gear anytime you like, and be up and working from a powered off state usually in about 10 minutes.

## Do You Feel the Need for APIC-EM at Home?
Are you ready to get started adding APIC-EM to your home lab? Or at least ready to begin some real analysis of what it would take? Great! The rest of this Learning Lab looks at two broad topics to consider: The APIC-EM software, and the networking device instances you need to have in your home lab so that they work well with APIC-EM.
